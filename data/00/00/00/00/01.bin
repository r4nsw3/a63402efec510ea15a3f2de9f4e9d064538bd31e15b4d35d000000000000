  |   A revolution broke out in shooting games in 1995. The Japanese        |
  |   brand "Psikyo" introduced a new enemy's attack, "Spread bullets"      |
  |   not seen before then, and the history of a new shooting game began.   |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Two years have passed since the settling of the soul hunting          |
  |   incident in which human souls were transplanted into mechanical       |
  |   bodies. As people were gradually recovering from the pain             |
  |   sustained, a new incident took place. One day, the puppet soldiers    |
  |   who should have disappeared, the fortress suddenly appears again.     |
  |   In order to unravel the truth behind the whole incident, a group of   |
  |   people took upon themselves to embrace the Hisouseki...               |
  |                                                                         |
